# Security

As project maintainers we take security bugs in [Wuffle](https://github.com/nikku/wuffle) seriously.

If you believe you have found a vulnerability, please report it to us [as described below](#reporting-security-issues).

__Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.__


## Reporting Security Issues

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, email [wuffle-dev@nixis.de](mailto:wuffle-dev@nixis.de) and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.

We will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, we will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the [npm contact form](https://www.npmjs.com/support) by selecting "I'm reporting a security vulnerability".
